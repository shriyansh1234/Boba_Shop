The Boba Shop project is a fully functional cross-platform application developed using Flutter and Firebase technologies. It offers users the ability to create accounts, login, and sign up to access a wide range of boba drinks. Users can browse through the available boba drink options, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout seamlessly.

One of the project's highlights is its task manager functionality, specifically designed for admins and workers. Administrators can create and assign tasks to workers, and upon task completion, the system provides detailed information such as the worker's name, date, and time. This feature enhances the workflow management within the app.

Moreover, the application incorporates essential security measures, including email verification, to ensure user data privacy and security. Additionally, it enhances user experience by offering dark and light theme mode options, allowing users to customize the app's appearance based on their preferences.

The Boba Shop project integrates two Restful APIs effectively. Firstly, it utilizes a weather-based API to recommend cold or hot boba drinks to users based on the prevailing weather conditions, enhancing the user's overall experience. Secondly, the project integrates a motivation API that provides inspirational quotes to workers, fostering a positive and motivated work environment.

With compatibility across Android, iOS, and web platforms, the Boba Shop app provides a seamless user experience and widens its reach to a diverse range of users.
